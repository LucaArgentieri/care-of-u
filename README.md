### Idea

CARE OF Ü is a web application designed to have the best information and communication kit between home and hospital.
It provides data and updates regarding the patient's health and allows for real-time communication between family members and doctors.
The site is divided into two distinct parts: the first part is the explanation of the service with a tour of all the features, the second part is the application itself.
As soon as you log in, you are asked for a code that is provided by the healthcare facility where the patient is admitted. By entering the code you have access to the dashboard where the patient's data are found, three types of vital data such as temperature, respiratory rate and heart rate. There is also a calendar with all the patient's appointments in a single day.
By consulting the lateral sidebar you can switch to the personal chat where, based on the type of therapy of the patient, we find the doctors who follow the patient with the possibility of receiving recipes and clarifications on the therapy.
After the chat there are two other items that are patient analysis, that is a collection of the tests carried out by the patient with the type of visit, outcome, description and the settings tab.
